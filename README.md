1.Finding sqaureroot of a number without using squareroot function<br>
Bitlevel algorithm to find square root of a number
<br>
<br>
2.Apriori algorithm<br>
Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases
It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and 
larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.
